  "name": "Tiling assistant",
  "description": "An extension which adds a Windows-like snap assist to GNOME. It changes GNOME's 2 column tiling design to a 2x2 grid. When a window is tiled and at least half the screen is occupied by tiled windows, a Dash containing icons with the non-tiled windows will open. Activating an icon will tile the corresponding window to fill the free space. If the free space spans 2 quadrants, you can hold Shift while activating the icon to tile the window to the top or the left free quadrant depending on the orientation of the free screen space and Alt to tile the window to the bottom or right quadrant. Please report issues on Github.",
