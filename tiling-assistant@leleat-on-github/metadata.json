  "description": "An extension which adds a Windows-like snap assist to GNOME. It changes GNOME's 2 column tiling design to a 2x2 grid. There are also ways to use more complex layouts...\n\nYou should remove GNOME's tiling keybindings and set them in the settings of this extension.\n\nAdditional features:\n\n - spiral tiling (hold Shift or Alt when tiling an app with the dash)\n - custom layouts\n - raise tiled windows as a group\n - and more...\n\nCheck out the README on Github for all features, on how to use them and report issues there as well.",
