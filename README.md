# Tiling assist for GNOME

An extension which adds a Windows-like snap assist to GNOME. This is only intended to work with the default tiling design (i.e. 2 vertical columns)... at least for now.

## Installation

You should install it via extensions.gnome.org. Alternatively you can also download the `tiling-assistant@leleat-on-github` folder and move it to the extensions folder (for example: /home/USERNAME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions).
